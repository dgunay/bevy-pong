## Bevy Pong clone

Making a Pong clone is a common rite of passage for budding game developers,
so I went with just that.

This is a simple Pong clone made using Bevy. It features:
* An absolute barebones main menu
* Screen shake based on relative collision velocity
* Local multiplayer

### Useful plugins

The `shake` and `window_scaling_2d` plugins here have potential uses in other
games; just follow their module documentation to make use of them.
